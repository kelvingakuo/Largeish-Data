## Usage

1. To use the join strategies, create test datasets (lists) in ```join_strategies.py``` then run: ```python join_strategies.py```
2. To create fake data, edit the file ```fake_data.py``` as needed
3. To play around with the DB, you need Docker and Docker-Compose installed. You also need the fake data in CSV files in ```db-data/```

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up```
